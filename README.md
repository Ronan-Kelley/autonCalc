# old javascript autoncalc

old javascript AutonCalc, made to graph already-drawn autons. Never ended up being much use, nor did it ever end up being accurate enough to justify continued development.

# this is LOW-QUALITY CODE.

this is only uploaded to here as its own branch in the unlikely event that it may be required for reference. This code is messy, this code is poorly designed, and this code isn't even fully functional. Do *NOT* use it as a model for how the main java project should be written, and do *NOT* use it as an educational reference, because it is not of high enough quality for either of those things.
